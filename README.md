## Hi, I'm Fran (Francisco SolÃ­s), and I love coffee and programming!
I not consider myself as a 100/100 developer, I just started programming and, I don't really know how I know this much to create programs, it's like if I want to learn a new programming language I just check some projects on GitHub and search for examples in Youtube and that's all what I need to start programming. I never read the docs until it's too late, I always start coding some stuff like, testing projects and things like that and then when I think "I don't know how to do this" I search in the docs. I've been through many programming languages, frameworks and APIs, but I personally think that my main work is Website Developer and Java Software Developer.
