## Hi, I'm Fran (Francisco SolÃ­s), and I love coffee and programming!
I not consider myself as a 100/100 developer, I just started programming and, I don't really know how I know this much to create programs, it's like if I want to learn a new programming language I just check some projects in GitHub and search for examples in Youtube and that's all what I need to start programming. I never read the docs until it's too late, I always start programming stuff like, testing projects and things like that and then when I think "I don't know how to do this" I search in the docs. Currently I'm working on the [Songoda](https://songoda.com) Marketplace Website as Developer and Manager, I have my own team [TheProgramSrc](https://github.com/TheProgramSrc), in TheProgramSrc I create some minecraft plugins, and I'm also working on Helprof, it's basically a set of tools for teachers, students, and schools.
