## Hi there!
I'm Francisco SolÃ­s, but I prefer to be called `Fran` ðŸ˜ƒ I was born in Santiago, Chile ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡±. My native language is Spanish but as you may already know I also know some English. I go by the pronouns He/Him. I love drinking coffee and coding. I'm currently learning and working with kotlin <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Im-Fran/Im-Fran/main/kotlin.svg" style="margin: auto; display_ block;" width="18"> and website development ðŸ˜›

### About Me
I don't consider myself as a 100/100 developer, I just started programming and, I don't really know how I know this much to create programs, it's like if I want to learn a new programming language I just check some projects on GitHub and search for examples in Youtube and that's all what I need to start programming. I never read the docs until it's too late, I always start coding some stuff like, testing projects and stuff.
When I think "I don't know how to do this" I search in the docs. I've been through many programming languages, frameworks and APIs, but I personally think that my main work is Website Developer and Java/Kotlin Software Developer.
