# What's in here?
Well, at the time of writing this, the load time of my zsh terminal was horrible (almost 5-10 seconds), 
so I started searching for a fix and I found a comment that said "here is a list of steps I wrote to fix the issue",
and I thought, what if I get into the same problem again? Now I'll be able to know what to do ðŸ˜„ and it might be helpful
for other people out there, so this is a list of issues I ran into and what I've tried to fix it, and once I fix the problem
it'll be added here ðŸ˜‰
